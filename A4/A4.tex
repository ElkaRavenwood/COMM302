\section{Map The Process to Acquire a Paying Customer}
    \subsection{Qualitative summary}
    The process to acquire a paying customer involves identifying leads, considering suspected potential users, engaging prospective users and finally stimulating the purchasing intent for qualified prospects. In order to continue earning after the initial purchase, customer loyalty must be assured through customer satisfaction and for further promotion, these satisfied customers will be Speechify's advocate amongst their peers.

    Of the action plans listed above, the ones with most confidence are customer advocacy and loyalty. Whereas, the action plan of least confidence is stimulating purchase intent. The following subsection details the action plans for each step in the customer acquisition process.
    \subsection{Action Plans}

                    \hline
                    Identification $\rightarrow$ Leads & Take advantage of search engine marketing and optimization to figure out who users are; become an in-kind sponsor to hackathons, and see who uses Speechify, and the types of hacks made  \\
                    \hline
                    Consideration $\rightarrow$ Suspects & Target people in the music, video editting, content creator industry and purchase ads in commonly used software for these users; become an in-kind sponsor for competitions for products/services that Speechify was most used for in hackathons (previous stage)  \\
                    \hline
                    Engagement $\rightarrow$ Prospects & Put user stories and feedback on marketing material, ensure that this is easily located; continue narrowing down users; create interactive demos / marketing materials to identified segments \\
                    \hline
                    Purchase Intent $\rightarrow$ Qualified Prospects & Create a sense of urgency by having a discount available only for a limited time, or the same thing but with paid features; If there are amazing existing projects that have used Speechify, contact their creator, ask for feedback, their story and permission to use it for marketing \\
                    \hline
                    Purchase $\rightarrow$ Customers & Offer discounted first months and free trials for premium features; use numbers to describe the time saved by existing users (or if none, estimated time saved) \\
                    \hline
                    Loyalty $\rightarrow$ Satisfied Customers & Ensure that the product is everything described and more (NOT less); offer discounts based on user type to sweeten the deal, particularly near the time of resubscription. \\
                    \hline
                    Advocacy $\rightarrow$ Evangelists & Offer promotions for [successful] referrals; create a platform that allows this to be done easily; consistently improve/add features or integration to existing software so that there is always "more" for existing users to talk about with peers\\

\section{LTV}
    \subsection{One Time Charge(s)}
        \subsubsection{What will your one-time charges be for each customer?}
        Individual users: \$60; Medium enterprises: \$3000; Large enterprises: \$10000

        \subsubsection{What is your estimated profit margin on your one-time charges?}
        This is a SAAS product thus, the idea of a profit margin per one-time charge isn't the most accurate or even feasible measure. Assuming yearly subscriptons of \$60 for basic features, and about \$20000 to make the basic product, Speechify will break even at 334 subscriptions.

        \subsubsection{What is the life of the product before a customer has to reppurchase the product?}

        1 year. However, if longer contracts are negotiated, that is with educational institutions for example, then it would be for the duration of the contract.

        \subsubsection{What percentage of customers will repurchase?}
        
        About 50\%. Students in institutions without a license will need it for 4 years. Dropouts won't. Bloggers and vloggers will renew it if they do well.

        \subsubsection{What will your recurring revenue streams be?}

        Same as repurchase - the renewing of subscriptions.

        \subsubsection{What is your profit margin on your recurring revenue streams?}

        Please see section 3.12

        \subsubsection{What is the retention rate for your recurring revenue streams?}
        
        Please see section 3.13 and below
        \begin{itemize}
            \begin{multicols}{2}
                \item After first/second year: 50\%
                \item After third year: 45\%
                \item After fourth year: 40\%
                \item After fifth year: 45\%
            \end{multicols}
        \end{itemize}
        These numbers are based on several assumptions and facts:
        \begin{itemize}
            \item Fact: there is currently no product on the market like Speechify
            \item Assumption: it will take around 2 years for competitors to develop a competing product
            \item Assumption: Speechify will have a strong brand name by the end of the first year
            \item Assumption (Goal): Speechify will sign a license with a large institution by latest, midway through the second year
            \item Assumption: As other competitors enter the market, Speechify may lose some customers, but also steal others that have been attracted by competitor products.
        \end{itemize} 

        \subsubsection{What other revenue sources will you have? What will your profit margin be, and is there a yearly retention rate applicable to them?}

        Ad-free usage or banner ads on the main website. These should cancel out the fees for posting advertisements of its own. There is no applicable yearly retention rate.

        \subsubsection{What will your cost of capital be, and why?} 
        Unknown - Assumed 50\% as per instructions

        [1] Note that Speechify is an SAAS product and thus, unit margins are not a useful calculation

        [2] These values are the one time fee

        [3] This is the one time fee multiplied by the retention rate (simple not compound)

    \subsection{Interpretation of Estimation}

        \subsubsection{What would you round your LTV estimation to? What range do you feel comfortable with?}

        250K. Not only was it calculated simply (as opposed to compounded), this value was rounded down. Speechify aims to err on the side of caution. 

        \subsubsection{Where do you feel the bigest unknowns are in your LTV estimation calculation?}

        Profit margins per unit. This is simply not possible to calculate due to the nature of the product. I estimate that the initial year and a half of revenue should go into costs for development, investments, marketing and research (about 96K) from research into other SAAS models. This results in it being about 150K.

        \subsubsection{Does the number seem reasonable?}

        Yes. It's conservative, but for 5 years, seems appropriate.

        \subsubsection{What are the key drivers of the LTV if you want to increase it?}

        Four key drivers were considered: Cross-Selling \& Up-Selling, Customer Advocacy \& Referrals, Repeat Purchases/Renewals and the cost to serve. The cost to serve will be constant - a site to host and distribute the product, and thus, not a major factor in increasing the LTV. Cross-Selling \% Up-Selling and Repeat Purchases/Renewals are the key drivers to Speechify's LTV. The previous section mapped out potential markets for expansion and the profit within. Speechify hopes to have retentioon rates of 50\%, which is a major part of the revenue stream, and the factor: Repeat Purchases/Renewals. Advocacy/Referrals will also increase the LTV, but those come with having a reliable product (which also causes the other two situations)

        \subsubsection{Where do you think you have the greatest opportunity to increase LTV, all things considered?}

        With repeat purchases/renewals. Speechify's base product and any subsequent expansions, integrations or features will cost a significant amount to build, but nothing outside of site hosting to resell. Any subscription renewal for the same product is thus arguably worth more for Speechify.

    \section{COCA}

        \subsection{Assumptions for COCA Estimation}
        
            \textbf{What time intervals did you define for the following phases in the Step 18 worksheet "Sales Channels for the Short, Medium and Long Term"?}

            Short Term: 1 year
            
            Medium Term: 3 years
            
            Long Term: 5 years

        \subsection{Total Sales and Marketing Expenses List}

            List the expected sales and marketing expenses, and their costs, This input will be used when estimating the COCA.

            Research shows that depending on the type of SAAS, significantly more money is spent on Marketing than Sales, and that it ranges from 30-35\% of the ARR each year.

    \subsection{Overall Interpretation of Unit Economics}
        \subsubsection{Basic 3X Test}
        The LTV is 3x more than the COCA. It clears it by a reasonable amount.
        \subsubsection{R\&D Factor}
        The R\&D Factor should be the same as an average SAAS company, that is, some testers, integrated software specialists and a team of developers will be needed, as with other SAAS companies.

        It ought to be noted that many of the features detailed in Figure 8 and Figure 9 would also be used by follow-up market operators. It should also be noted that Video Editors are a subset of Content Creators (see previous assignment). However, the ones being targeted in the beachhead market are the young professionals. The follow-up market for video editors refers to industry professionals and teams.

    \subsection{Other Activities beyong the functionality for the Beachhead Market}
        \begin{enumerate}
            \item Offer referral bonuses. It will be similar to the EQ Bank system, where each successful referral rewards the referrer with some amount of money. This value increases for subsequent referrals before reaching a cap.
            \item Research additional target segments. This process was outlined earlier, but is essential to see if there are better customers, and if so, how to access them. However, focus will primarily be on acquiring customers from the selected segment, as infrastructure is already there, and to retain existing customers, as they are worth "more" per renewal as with the nature of SAAS products.
            \item Find a PR team that attends hackathons/innovation challenges and gicves speeches. This is essential for raising awareness of the product and for enticing future users.
